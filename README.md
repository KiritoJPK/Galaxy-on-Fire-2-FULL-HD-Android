### GOF2 android with full hd textures from Windows and macOS.



- Apk mod based on modifications created by 4PDA users Dhаmpir, atang, Droid378, leningroz and .Ворон.
- Retexturing using AEI Editor with the full hd textures from the Windows/macOS version.
- This mod includes not only full hd textures but also bug fixes and improvements, such as:



☆ A menu at the start of the app that adjusts the ui and touch scale according to your needs.

☆ Tablet resolution for any device.

☆ Removed the 30fps limitation (managed to get to 120fps on pocophone F3).

☆ Fixed bug with "0" numbers not appearing.

☆ Fixed a bug with ripples in jumpgates, kaamo boards and various other things that happened on some devices.

☆ Improved sound quality.

☆ Miscellaneous fixes to engine fires on some ships.

☆ The game's economy has been changed to the original version of Windows/MacOS/iOS, because on android they were too abusive.

☆ Added a version with post-processing FX (Bloom) enabled, but the stripe bugs are back (Thanks Ravenstal).

☆ Added a version with a new system using reverse engineering, but it crashes randomly (Thanks Ravenstal).

☆ And many other fixes and improvements.
