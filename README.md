- Modifications to the apk was done by me based on modifications created by 4PDA users Dhаmpir, atang, Droid378 and .Ворон.
- The retexturing was done by me using the FHD textures from the PC/MAC version.
- This mod includes not only full hd textures but also bug fixes and improvements, such as:



☆ A menu at the start of the app that adjusts the ui and touch scale according to your needs.

☆ Tablet resolution for any device.

☆ Removed the 30fps limitation (managed to get to 120fps on pocophone F3).

☆ Fixed bug with "0" numbers not appearing.

☆ Fixed a bug with ripples in jumpgates, kaamo boards and various other things that happened on some devices.

☆ Improved sound quality.

☆ Miscellaneous fixes to engine fires on some ships.

☆ An alternate version of the game with the prices and diagram requirements of the IOS version.

☆ And many other fixes and improvements.
